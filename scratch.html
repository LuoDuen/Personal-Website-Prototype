        Here is a list of my favorite quotes that guide my philosphy:
        
        <ol>
        
            <ul>
                <div>Jesus Christ: "Whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister. And whosever will be chiefest shall be servant of all."
                </div>
                <br><br>
                
                <div>Confucius: "Humility is the solid foundation of all virtues."
                </div>
                
                <br><br>
                
                <div>Mencius: "'If a man love others, and no responsive attachment is shown to him, let him turn inwards and examine his own benevolence. If he is trying to rule others, and his government is unsuccessful, let him turn inwards and examine his wisdom. If he treats others politely, and they do not return his politeness, let him turn inwards and examine his own feeling of respect. When we do not, by what we do, realise what we desire, we must turn inwards, and examine ourselves in every point. When a man's person is correct, the whole kingdom will turn to him with recognition and submission."
                </div>
                
                <br><br>
                
                <div>Sun Tzu: "You must be swift as the wind, dense as the forest, rapacious as fire, steadfast like a mountain, mysterious as night and mighty as thunder."
                </div>
            </ul>
        </ol>
